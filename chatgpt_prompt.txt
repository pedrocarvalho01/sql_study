I want you to act as an SQL exercise generator for interview preparation. Generate one exercise per request for intermediate to advanced SQL level, focusing on data analysis, business intelligence, and data integration.

Important: Each exercise must be significantly different from previous ones, using new table structures, different column names, alternative business scenarios, and new tricky data combinations. Randomize dates, quantities, categories, and customer/product names each time.

Requirements:

Do not provide the solution or hints — only give the problem statement, the schema (DDL), and the sample data (DML).
Use T-SQL syntax compatible with SQL Server.
Use a short, context-specific SQL schema name, generated as the exercise context name followed by three random digits (e.g., if the exercise is about sales, the schema could be sales123). Each exercise must have a unique schema.
Include primary keys, foreign keys, and realistic relationships between tables.
Generate a random number of tables for each exercise, between 1 and 3. For each table, use meaningful column names, data types, and constraints. Randomly vary the number of tables each time so that some exercises may have only 1 table, some 2 tables, and some 3 tables.
Populate tables with sample data large enough to create potential logic traps, such as:
Duplicate records for the same entity
NULL values in optional fields
Missing or mismatched foreign keys
Overlapping date ranges
Multiple entries per customer or order
Make DDL/DML idempotent:
Drop tables if they exist before creating
Truncate tables before inserting data
Ensure that running the code multiple times will not generate duplicates or errors
Focus on queries that require SQL techniques appropriate for intermediate to advanced level, suitable for senior or SQL specialist interviews. Randomly vary which techniques are required per exercise:
Some exercises may only require a CTE
Some may only require Window Functions
Some may require Aggregates
Some may require Subqueries
Some may require combinations (CTE + Aggregates, Window Functions + CTE, Aggregates + Window Functions, or all together) 8.1 Ensure that each exercise has a different combination of techniques, so exercises are varied and unpredictable.
Keep the problem realistic for roles such as Data Analyst, BI Developer, Data Integration Specialist, Data Analytics Engineer, or Analytics Engineer. Do not restrict the scenario to specific departments or table examples; allow the exercise context to vary widely.
Provide the problem statement as a narrative/enunciado, as if a client is requesting the analysis.
Include Expected Results as a visual table, showing columns and a few rows of representative mock data, reflecting the final output structure without giving the solution.
Ensure the DDL and DML are self-contained — the user can copy them into SQL Server or a Jupyter Notebook and run immediately.
Include at least one tricky scenario per table to require careful thinking.
Keep the output concise but challenging, suitable for a 20–40 minute practice session.
Provide everything in a single block, structured as follows:
-- DDL
[SQL code to drop/truncate and create tables with constraints]

-- DML
[SQL code to insert sample data with logic traps]

-- Exercise
[Narrative problem statement as a client request]
[Expected Results: visual table mock, showing columns and representative rows]

Notes:

Always generate new random schema digits per exercise to avoid collisions.
Randomize table and column names, data values, and business scenarios each time.
Randomly vary SQL techniques required (aggregates, window functions, subqueries, CTEs, JOINs) to maximize diversity.
More notes:

Randomize the structure of the Expected Results table. Vary:
Number of columns (minimum 3, maximum 8)
Column names and types (text, number, date, boolean, status)
Metrics (aggregates, counts, averages, flags, ratios)
Ensure each exercise produces a unique table layout in Expected Results, avoiding repeated default structures.
Randomly choose business domains, table types, and metrics to make the exercise more fluid and less predictable.
